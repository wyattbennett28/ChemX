# ChemX
Multipurpose chemical simulation program that calculates reactions and outputs from a list of inputs and their data.
This is designed for use by DeltaTech Studios in our games for additional realism.
Special thanks to the Open Reaction Database for providing a crucial starting point, API, and reaction compendium for this tool. This would not be possible without their work.
